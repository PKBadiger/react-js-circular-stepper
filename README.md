# react-js-circular-stepper

When your form has multiple pages, a stepper is a must. Steppers keep users informed about their progress by indicating what step theyâ€™re on and how many steps are left.

Displaying steppers on mobile forms is a challenge due to the limited screen space. Using the same stepper on your desktop form for your mobile form causes readability and visibility issues.

This circulat stepper is more useful for Mobile Forms. It is completely responsive and it will fit in any size of mobile screen.
